text,black,normal,400,"There was once a merchant so wealthy that he could have paved the whole street with pieces of silver, but he did not squander his money as a matter of [parsimony]. The miser had other ideas for how to allocate and invest his money, and whenever he spent a shilling, he earned a [colossal profit] in return. Frugal in life, he died a prosperous man. "
text,black,normal,400,"All his money then went to his only son. But the son lived extravagantly and spent all his time clowning and carousing. He carelessly spent the wealth on going to [masquerades] every evening, making money into impractical kites, and skipping gold pieces across the pond instead of stones. "
text,black,normal,400,"As a result, his immense inheritance vanished until he was penniless. In fact, his wardrobe was reduced to a pair of slippers and an old dressing gown. "
text,black,normal,400,"His friends never really cared about him, and now that they could not spend his money, they abandoned him. One of them, however, was more [benevolent] (albeit still exasperated) than the rest, and he [bequeathed] him an old trunk with this advice, “Pack up and be off!” This was all very fine, but he had nothing that he could pack up and simply put himself into the trunk, but little did he know, it was a magical trunk! When the lock was latched, the whole trunk could fly. "
text,black,normal,400,"The merchant’s son closed the lock and up flew the trunk with him through the chimney, high into the clouds, on and on, higher and higher. The lower part cracked, which frightened him because if it had broken in half, he would have plunged and quickly met his demise! However, it descended safely, and he found himself in Turkey. He hid the trunk under a heap of dry leaves in a forest and walked into the next town, but no one looked twice at his attire, for Turkish people go about in dressing gowns and slippers."
