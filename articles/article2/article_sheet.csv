text,black,normal,400,"Romantic music is music written in the [19th century]. This is called the [“Romantic period”] by musicians. Prior to this, music was written differently. In [the Classical period], for example, artists liked to see clear forms. "
text,black,normal,400,"One example is [18th-century] architecture, which often featured symmetrical forms. The gardens of the palace at Versailles are a good example of Classical Period preferences. The gardens have tidy patterns of straight paths, circular ponds, and neatly clipped hedges. "
text,black,normal,400,"Classical composers such as Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, and Schubert favored music with a clear plan, like the sonata form. In contrast, Romantic period artists thought that feeling and passion were more important. This can be seen in the gardens designed by Capability Brown at Blenheim Palace in Oxford. The gardens are designed to blend into nature."
text,black,normal,400,"Romantic composers still employed the Classical sonata form in their music. However, feelings and passions were equally important. They often wrote what is called program music, which describes something or tells a story."
text,black,normal,400,"Beethoven’s Sixth Symphony, the “ [Pastoral],” is about how it felt to travel in the countryside. Although Beethoven is usually called a Classical composer, he is also an early Romantic."
text,black,normal,400,"Later composers such as Felix Mendelssohn wrote pieces like “Hebrides Overture,” which describes the [sea coming into Fingal’s Cave] in the Inner Hebrides Islands in Scotland."
text,black,normal,400,Hector Berlioz also wrote music that told a story. His “Symphonie Fantastique” is about an artist madly in love. Berlioz’s whole way of life was wild and romantic. He fell in love with an actress he saw on stage playing the part of Juliet. He pursued her until he actually married her.
