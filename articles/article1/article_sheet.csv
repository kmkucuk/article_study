text,black,normal,400,"Born in 1925, Medgar Evers grew up under [segregation] in the deep South. He walked 12 miles daily to get to school, eventually earning his high school diploma. Evers served in the U.S. Army from 1943 to 1945, including as a sergeant at the [Battle of Normandy]. After the war, he attended and studied business at a [historically black college] now known as Alcorn State University, and he graduated in 1952 and moved to Mound Bayou, Mississippi—a town developed by African Americans."
text,black,normal,400,"As a military veteran who found for his country, Evers expected that he would be able to vote. However, he and five friends were deterred at gunpoint. Racism denied his equal rights. "
text,black,normal,400,"Later, he organized boycotts of gas stations with the slogan “Don’t Buy Gas Where You Can’t Use the Restroom.” To fight state laws that made segregation legal, Evers applied to attend the University of Mississippi Law School, but his application was rejected because of his race. "
text,black,normal,400,"That same year, Evers was named the [NAACP's] first field secretary for Mississippi. In this position, he helped organize [boycotts] and set up new local chapters of the NAACP. He tried to desegregate public beaches, buses, and parks. "
text,black,normal,400,"Evers led voter registration drives, advocated for [school integration], and led investigations into the murder of the teenager Emmett Till. Evers was a prominent black voice, and that made him a target."
text,black,normal,400,"In the 1960s, [civil rights activists] lived under constant threat. In May 1963, a bomb was thrown into his garage, and then someone tried to hit him with a car. "
text,black,normal,400,"In June 1963, Evers returned home without his usual FBI or police escort. As he got out of his car, carrying a box of NAACP t-shirts that said “Jim Crow Must Go,” Medgar Evers was shot and killed. Mourned nationally, Evers was buried in Arlington National Cemetery, where he received full military honors."
