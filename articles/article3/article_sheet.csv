text,black,normal,400,"[Greek mythology] contains stories and legends about their pantheon of gods and goddesses. The stories are diverse in their characters, with monsters and heroes, fools and warriors, as well as gods, goddesses, and regular everyday humans. "
text,black,normal,400,"Some stories focus on full humans whose parents are both humans. Telemachos is the son of Odysseus and Penelope. Many thought Odysseus was dead, so they wanted to marry Penelope. The goddess Athena disguised herself and told Telemachos to look for his father. He set up a search party and ultimately also believed his father was dead. Telemachos organized a competition for potential suitors to win and claim Penelope, and Odysseus arrived secretly to win the competition and rejoin his family. This is a story about the transition to manhood."
text,black,normal,400,"Another story about a human is that of Cassandra, Helen of Troy’s twin sister and daughter of the King of Troy. The god Apollo wanted to marry Cassandra, so he gave her the [gift of prophecy]. She rejected him. Apollo wanted to take her gift away, but since he couldn’t, he changed her power to only allow her to see bad things. No one would believe her visions. Cassandra foresaw the [Trojan Horse trick], but no one believed her. Troy was destroyed. Cassandra became [Agamemnon’s] slave. She tried to warn him of an assassination attempt, but no one believed her again. He was assassinated, and she was put to death shortly thereafter. "
text,black,normal,400,"Greek myths are fascinating stories from history that were used by the Greeks to explain the world around them and teach lessons. Many of the myths are impossibly magical or divine, but many–even the fanciful ones–have a basis in historical fact. No one knows who wrote (or told) the original stories. Historians believe the collection originated in oral traditions dating all the way back to the [Bronze Age]. Over time, the stories were refined and elaborated upon until they became the stories we know today."
