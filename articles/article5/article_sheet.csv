text,black,normal,400,"For decades, people have been taught that Watson and Crick discovered DNA. Unfortunately, that’s not exactly accurate. A British [biophysicist] named Rosalind Franklin made the discovery first. Her work showed that DNA was built like a [double helix]. "
text,black,normal,400,"How? She used something called x-ray crystallography, which “takes pictures” at the molecular level. These pictures were then used by Watson and Crick without her permission to claim the discovery of the double helix."
text,black,normal,400,"There’s some debate about how it happened. In 1953, Watson and Crick were trying to build a [3D model] of what DNA might look like, but they hadn’t seen an image yet. Franklin’s student lab assistant—Raymond Gosling—shared Franklin’s famous Photo 51 with Watson and Crick before she was even able to see it. They used the information to discern the molecular structure of DNA. Two months later, they published their research and got the scoop."
text,black,normal,400,"Franklin’s name was left off of the research, as she had left to teach at another university the month before. "
text,black,normal,400,"She died of cancer in 1958, and the Nobel committee nominated Watson and Crick’s research in 1962. Since Nobel prizes cannot be awarded to dead people, Rosalind Franklin’s name was again left out. Watson and Crick won the Nobel Prize that year, and every year since, school children have learned their names as the discoverers of DNA."
text,black,normal,400,"As a result, Rosalind Franklin’s important contribution to DNA, which ultimately led to us being able to understand the [human genome], was largely forgotten for decades. "
text,black,normal,400,Recently scholars have recognize that she was a woman working in a male-dominated field and faced [discrimination]. She contributed scientific research that brought “lasting benefit” to humanity. Even Crick acknowledges her contribution. 
text,black,normal,400,"Rosalind Franklin pursued her science relentlessly, and now her story inspires the next generations."
